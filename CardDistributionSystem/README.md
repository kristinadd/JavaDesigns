Design a system for a card distribution system for new clients and implement multithreaded functionality 
with non-blocking deposit and withdrawal methods.

1. Understand the Requirements
Card Distribution System:
  A service that assigns cards (credit/debit) to new clients.
Likely involves client data, card inventory, and card assignment logic.
Multithreaded Application:
  Multiple threads handle simultaneous operations, such as managing client accounts or transactions.
Non-blocking Methods:
  Deposit and withdraw operations should not block other threads (e.g., avoid locks or waits). Techniques like Atomic variables or lock-free algorithms may be used.

2. Define the System Components
a. Core Entities
Client:
  Stores client details like name, ID, and associated accounts/cards.
Account:
  Represents the account with a balance. Use a BankAccount class/interface as in your previous examples.
Card:
  Represents a card assigned to a client.
b. Services
CardService:
  Handles card assignment and management.
AccountService:
  Manages accounts and provides thread-safe deposit and withdrawal.
ClientService:
  Manages client registration and links accounts/cards to clients.

3. Implement Multithreading
a. Non-blocking Deposit/Withdraw
Use java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference or AtomicInteger for thread-safe balance updates:

b. Multithreaded Card Assignment
Use a thread pool to process multiple client registrations and assign cards concurrently.

4. Design the System Architecture
High-Level Diagram
Client Registration:
  Register clients and link them to accounts.
Account Management:
  Manage balances with thread-safe operations.
Card Assignment:
  Assign unique cards to clients using the CardService.

In Java, the AtomicInteger class is part of the java.util.concurrent.atomic package 
and provides a way to perform thread-safe, lock-free operations on an integer value. 
It is particularly useful when multiple threads need to read, modify, or update a 
shared integer variable concurrently without the overhead of explicit synchronization 
(like using synchronized blocks or Locks).

When dealing with financial systems or any application where maintaining an accurate balance is 
critical, and multiple threads may simultaneously update a shared balance variable, you need to 
ensure consistency and thread safety. The AtomicInteger class provides this functionality efficiently.

# Why Use AtomicInteger?

Thread-Safe Increment/Decrement: AtomicInteger provides atomic methods like incrementAndGet() and decrementAndGet() to safely increase or decrease a value without interference from other threads.

CAS (Compare-And-Swap): It uses low-level CPU instructions for atomicity. This avoids the need for locks, reducing contention and improving performance.

Non-Blocking: Unlike synchronized methods or locks, AtomicInteger does not block threads. Instead, it retries the operation if there is contention, making it suitable for high-concurrency environments.

Ease of Use: The API is straightforward and purpose-built for atomic operations.
